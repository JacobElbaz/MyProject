# User Management App

## Project Description

The User Management App is a full-stack application built with Node.js and React.js. It provides a simple and secure way to manage user information, allowing users to register, log in, and view a list of registered users. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, handles user authentication, while the frontend, developed with React.js, enables an intuitive user interface.

### Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login functionality.
- **Token-Based Authorization:** Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage user sessions.
- **Protected User List:** Access to the user list is restricted to authenticated users.
- **Form Validation:** Implements client-side validation for registration and login forms.
- **Responsive Design:** User-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes.
